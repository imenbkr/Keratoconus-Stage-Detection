medical and family history of the patient.\n","\n","Often, various tools and technologies are used to determine more details regarding the shape of the patient's cornea. \n","\n","Tests to diagnose keratoconus include:\n","* __Eye refraction__: in which the doctor will use special equipment that measures eyes to check for vision problems.\n","<img

__Slit-lamp examination__: in which the doctor will evaluate the shape of the cornea and looks for other potential problems in the patient's eye, by directing a vertical beam of light on its surface and using a low-powered microscope to view it. \n","\n","* __Keratometry__: In this test the eye doctor focuses a circle of light on the cornea and measures the reflection to determine the basic shape of the cornea.\n","\n","* __Computerized corneal mapping__: Which consists of special photographic tests, such as corneal tomography and corneal topography. It is basically recording images to create a detailed shape map of the cornea.\n","\n","  * <font color='red'>corneal topography:</font> by taking a picture of the eye with an instrument called corneal topographer, we can easily detect the changes of the cone that is developping in the surface of the eye.\n","  ![rsz_capture_d’écran_708.jpg](attachment:8a710986-3ddb-47d9-9fd5-161ffe8b23ad.jpg)\n","  \n","    <img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/u4vv676b8z52/7dSFrf8D45lr0CDgUB5ZF0/1caa41c858ed9905337fe1445f1fc8e6/corneal-topography-678x446.gif?fm=jpg&q=80\" align ='center' width=\"250\">\n","  \n","  \n","  * <font color='red'> corneal tomography:</font> that is getting many B-scan ultrasounds of the eye [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2765186/).
